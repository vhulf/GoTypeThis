# GoTypeThis

Make the gopher type for ya!

Sometimes you need alotta text to be placed inside of restrictive environments for completely non-nefarious reasons.... this script can be used to type effective keystrokes into Citrix-type RDP sessions, and does a pretty good job of doing it accurately with the commonly typable characters including the special variety! Burp license friendly c:


Usage:::

`go run typeThis.go ~/fileForTyping.txt`

Defaults to 10 second init time and a 20 millisecond character throttle, but that can be changed with constants at the top of the script v easily! Maybe add proper args and make a pull request about it    : ]
